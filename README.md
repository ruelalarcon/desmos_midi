# Desmos Music Player

> A Rust-based CLI tool for converting MIDI files into formulas for Desmos.

## Installation

To use the MIDI Player, you must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system. Clone this repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruelalarcon/desmos_music.git
cd desmos_music
```

## Usage

Once you have a MIDI file you wish to use, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run <midi_file> [output_file]
```
- `<midi_file>`: Path to the input MIDI file to convert
- `<output_file>`: Path to a file to export the formula to, if not provided, the formula will be copied to the clipboard.

### Usage Examples

Convert MIDI file `song.mid` to playable format:
```bash
cargo run song.mid
```

The first time this command is run, cargo will install all the necessary Rust dependencies before copying the formulas to the clipboard. After this, paste the contents of your clipboard into Desmos.

Now enable audio in Desmos through the button in the top left:

### Controls

- To play the song, hit the arrow button to the left of the `t -> 0` formula.
- To end the song, hit the arrow button to the left of the `t -> âˆž` formula.
- You may also set the value of `t` manually to seek to a specific point in the song.

## Technical Details

### MIDI Processing

1. **MIDI Parsing**:
   - Uses the `midly` crate to parse MIDI files
   - Extracts note events (Note On/Off) and timing information
   - Handles tempo changes to ensure accurate timing

2. **Timing Conversion**:
   - Converts MIDI ticks to milliseconds using the formula:
     ```
     ms = (ticks * tempo) / (ticks_per_quarter * 1000)
     ```
   - Where:
     - `ticks`: MIDI event time in ticks
     - `tempo`: Microseconds per quarter note (default: 500000 = 120 BPM)
     - `ticks_per_quarter`: MIDI file's time division (ticks per quarter note)

3. **Note Processing**:
   - Tracks active notes at each timestamp
   - Converts MIDI note numbers to relative positions from Bb (MIDI note 58)
   - Generates a Desmos piecewise function in the format:
     ```
     A=\left\{t<1:\left[0,4,7\right],t<2:\left[2,5,9\right],...\right\}
     ```
   - Where each number represents semitones relative to Bb (0)

## Dependencies

- `midly`: MIDI file parsing
- `clipboard`: System clipboard integration
