# Desmos MIDI Player

> A Rust-based CLI tool for converting MIDI files into formulas for Desmos. Complete with support for note velocity, tempo changes, and even custom soundfonts for different channels/instruments.

## Installation

To use the MIDI Player, you must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

**Windows:**
- No additional prerequisites

**Linux/WSL (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Install X11 development libraries
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```

**Other Linux distributions:**
- Equivalent X11 development packages for your package manager

### Building

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruelalarcon/desmos_midi.git
cd desmos_midi
```

Then build the project using the provided script:

**Windows:**
```bash
./build.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./build.sh
```
> Note: You may need to run `chmod +x *.sh` first to make the scripts executable if they aren't by default.

To clean build artifacts at any time, you can use:
```bash
./clean.bat  # Windows
./clean.sh   # Linux/Mac
```

## Usage

Navigate to [this Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dgkzdezlzf).

Once you have a MIDI file you wish to use, run the following command:

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
./run.bat <midi_file>  # Windows
./run.sh <midi_file>   # Linux/Mac
```
> Note: From now on, we will use `.sh` for the rest of the examples, but if you are on Windows make sure to use the `.bat` versions instead.

**Advanced Usage:**
```bash
./run.sh <midi_file> -s <soundfont1> <soundfont2> ...  # Specify soundfonts for each channel
./run.sh <midi_file> -i                                # Show channel information
```

### Arguments
- `<midi_file>`: Path to the input MIDI file to convert
- `-s, --soundfonts <FILES>`: Soundfont files to use for each channel (optional)
- `-i, --info`: Show MIDI channel information and exit
- `-c, --copy`: Copy output to clipboard instead of console

### Soundfonts
By default:
- Regular channels use `default.txt` soundfont
- Drum channels (channel 10) are automatically ignored
- To include drum sounds or use different soundfonts, use the `-s` option and specify a soundfont for each channel
- Use `-` as a soundfont name to ignore that channel

### Usage Examples

1. Basic conversion with default settings (drums ignored):
```bash
./run.sh song.mid
```

2. View channel information:
```bash
./run.sh song.mid -i
```

3. Specify custom soundfonts:
```bash
./run.sh song.mid -s default.txt sine.txt - default.txt
```
This will use:
- `default.txt` for channel 1
- `sine.txt` for channel 2
- ignore channel 3
- `default.txt` for channel 4

4. Copy to clipboard instead of console output:
```bash
./run.sh song.mid -c
```

Now enable audio in Desmos through the button in the top left:

### Graph Controls

- To play the song, hit the arrow button to the left of the `t -> 0` formula.
- To end the song, hit the arrow button to the left of the `t -> âˆž` formula.
- You may also set the value of `t` manually to seek to a specific point in the song.
- Open the "Settings" folder to adjust:
  - `velocity`: Animation phase speed
  - `scale`: Visual waveform amplitude
  - `hertz`: Base frequency (default 440Hz)
  - `detune`: The amount of detune applied to the secondary tone
  - `volume`: Global volume control
  - `transpose`: Global pitch shift in semitones

## Technical Details

### MIDI Processing

1. **MIDI Parsing**:
   - Uses the `midly` crate to parse MIDI files
   - Extracts note events (Note On/Off) and timing information
   - Handles tempo changes to ensure accurate timing
   - Preserves note velocities (0-127) for dynamic volume control
   - Properly tracks note durations for accurate playback

2. **Timing Conversion**:
   - Converts MIDI ticks to milliseconds using the formula:
     ```
     ms = (ticks * tempo) / (ticks_per_quarter * 1000)
     ```
   - Where:
     - `ticks`: MIDI event time in ticks
     - `tempo`: Microseconds per quarter note (default: 500000 = 120 BPM)
     - `ticks_per_quarter`: MIDI file's time division (ticks per quarter note)

3. **Note Processing**:
   - Tracks active notes and their velocities at each timestamp
   - Converts MIDI note numbers to relative positions from A (MIDI note 69 / 440 Hz)
   - Each note is paired with its velocity value and duration
   - Generates a Desmos piecewise function in the format:
     ```
     A=\left\{t<1:\left[0,100,0\right],t<2:\left[2,85,0\right],...\right\}
     ```
   - Where each note is represented by three values:
     - Semitones relative to A4 (440Hz)
     - Velocity (0-127)
     - Soundfont index

4. **Section Processing**:
   - If a MIDI file is too long for Desmos to parse, the program will automatically split it into sections
   - The sections are named `A_{1}`, `A_{2}`, etc.
   - The main `A` formula selects the appropriate section based on time

5. **Soundfont Processing**:
   - Soundfonts are stored in the `soundfonts/` directory and are text files containing comma-separated floating point values representing harmonic weights (weights for each frequency in the harmonic series, which can be used to generate a static waveform)
   - The `B` is a "list of lists" of harmonic weights, however, Desmos does not support nested lists so instead, the `C` value is the maximum size of the soundfont arrays (after padding) and we use that to index sublists in `B`

## Dependencies

- `midly`: MIDI file parsing
- `clipboard`: System clipboard integration
- `clap`: Command line argument parsing
